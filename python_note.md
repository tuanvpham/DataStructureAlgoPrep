# Some notes for Python

- Variables, Names, and Objects
	- everything is booleans, integers, floats, strings
	- an object: clear plastic box that contains a piece of data
	- immutable object: a closed box with a clear window (can see value, but can't change it)
	- mutable object: an open box, but can't change its type
	- variables: names (a reference to a thing rather than the thing itself - sticky note)
	- assingment does not copy a value; it just attaches a name to the object that contains data
